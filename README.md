# Abstract

The predictability of the cryptocurrency market is a current and highly researched
topic. However, the cross-market influences on the returns of the cryptocur-
rencies would benefit from different perspectives. This study examines the
dynamic interplay between Bitcoin, Ethereum, and traditional financial indices
spanning from 2017 and 2023 using the Mixture Transition Distribution (MTD)
and Generalized Multivariate Markov Chain (GMMC) models. The findings indi-
cate the presence of autocorrelation within each cryptocurrency, as well as an
influence of a diverse set of financial indices. Evidence suggest different sector
indices affect the cryptocurrencies with distinct degrees of influence. Addition-
ally, the results demonstrate cross-currency influence, notably Ethereum's in-
fluence on Bitcoin, suggesting a more interconnected market.
